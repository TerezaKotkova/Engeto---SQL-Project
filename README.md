# Data_academy_sql_project

Introduction to the SQL project:

In your analytical department of an independent company that deals with the standard of living of citizens, you have agreed to try to answer a few research questions that address the availability of basic foodstuffs to the general public. 

Colleagues have already defined the basic questions that they will try to answer and provide this information to the press department. This department will present the results at the next conference focused on this area.

To do this, they need you to prepare robust data bases in which it will be possible to see a comparison of food availability based on average incomes over a certain period of time.

As additional material, prepare a table with GDP, GINI coefficient and population of other European countries in the same period, as a primary overview for the Czech Republic.






Questions:

1. Are the wages rising in all industries over the years, or are they descaling in some of them?

Wages in Czech Republic incresed over the years, the best years were between 2000 - 2009. They rised the most in these industries: 
Informační a komunikační činnosti, Peněžnictví a pojišťovnictví, Výroba a rozvod elektřiny, plynu, tepla a klimatiz. vzduchu.
 Between 2014 - 2016 they were descaling in just one industry (mostly Těžba a dobývání). The worste results accured between the years 2020 - 2021 in these industries: 
Ubytování, stravování a pohostinství, Činnosti v oblasti nemovitosti, Vzdělávání, Zemědělství, lesnictví, rybářství, Kulturní, zábavní a rekreační činnosti. 

2.  How many litres of milk and how many kilograms of bread can be bought in the first and last comparable periods in the available price and wage data. 

3. Which price in food category is increasing slowest (has the lowest year-on-year percentage increase?)

4. Is there a year in which the year-on-year increase in food prices was significantly higher than wage growth (greater than 10%)?

5. Does the level of GDP effect changes in wages and food prices? Or, if the GDP increases more significantly in one year, will this be reflected in food prices or wages in the same or the following year by a more significant increase?
Or, if the GDP increases more significantly in one year, will this be reflected in food prices or wages in the same or the following year by a more significant increase?
