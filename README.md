# Data_academy_sql_project

Introduction to the SQL project:

In your analytical department of an independent company that deals with the standard of living of citizens, you have agreed to try to answer a few research questions that address the availability of basic foodstuffs to the general public. 

Colleagues have already defined the basic questions that they will try to answer and provide this information to the press department. This department will present the results at the next conference focused on this area.

To do this, they need you to prepare robust data bases in which it will be possible to see a comparison of food availability based on average incomes over a certain period of time.

As additional material, prepare a table with GDP, GINI coefficient and population of other European countries in the same period, as a primary overview for the Czech Republic.






Questions:

1. Are the wages rising in all industries over the years, or are they descaling in some of them?

Wages in Czech Republic incresed over the years, the best years were between 2000 - 2009. They rised the most in these industries: 
Informační a komunikační činnosti, Peněžnictví a pojišťovnictví, Výroba a rozvod elektřiny, plynu, tepla a klimatiz. vzduchu.
 Between 2014 - 2016 they were descaling in just one industry (mostly Těžba a dobývání). The worste results accured between the years 2020 - 2021 in these industries: 
Ubytování, stravování a pohostinství, Činnosti v oblasti nemovitosti, Vzdělávání, Zemědělství, lesnictví, rybářství, Kulturní, zábavní a rekreační činnosti. 

2.  How many litres of milk and how many kilograms of bread can be bought in the first and last comparable periods in the available price and wage data. 

From source data of Český statistický úřad we are able to compare first data for 2006 and last data for 2018. Customer with an average monthly gross income in 2006 was able to buy 1466 litres of milk and in 2018 the amount was 1670 litres. In 2006 he was able to buy 1313 kg of bread and in 2018 1365 kg of bread. 


3. Which price in food category is increasing the slowest (has the lowest year-on-year percentage increase?)

In the prepared table we can see indivudal food prices and how prices had increased between years 2006 - 2018. The price increased the most from 2006 - 2007 for the product Papriky by 94.82 % (2006, 35.31 kc and  2007 68.79 kc). The price decreased the most from 2006 - 2007 for the product Rajská jablka červená kulatá by 30 % (2006, 57.83 kc - 2007, 40.32 kc). 

The smallest price difference we can see from 2017 - 2018 (142.58 kc - 142.45 kc) for Eidamská cihla by 0.09 % dicreased. 
The smallest price increased was in 2008 - 2009 (84.4 kc - 84.41kc ) for Rostlinný roztíratelný tuk by 0.01 %.

In overal of the measured period (2006 - 2018) the biggest percentage price differnces we can see for Cukr krystalový decreased by 23.03 % and the biggest increased for Papriky by 87.53 % 
The smallest price differences in overal was for Jakostní víno bílé by 8.1 %,  Banány žluté by 9.69 %, Rajská jablka červená kulatá -8.88 %. 

4. Is there a year in which the year-on-year increase in food prices was significantly higher than wage growth (greater than 10%)?

5. Does the level of GDP effect changes in wages and food prices? Or, if the GDP increases more significantly in one year, will this be reflected in food prices or wages in the same or the following year by a more significant increase?
Or, if the GDP increases more significantly in one year, will this be reflected in food prices or wages in the same or the following year by a more significant increase?
